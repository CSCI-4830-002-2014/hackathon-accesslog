# Loyalty program

## Description
In order to increase sales, we are going to offer a loyalty program to the top 30 customers.
There is no doubt that the same product for less of a cost is more desirable, but you cannot offer reduced priced products to everyone as we cannot simply make profit. Thus, in order to increase revenue and increase sales, these reduced prices will only be offered to the 30 most "loyal" customers. We defined a loyal customer as someone who is within the sites top 30 purchasers.

## Rationale 1

```
productId=* (action="purchase") | top limit=30 clientip
```

The top 30 users that performed the most "purchase" actions.

## Rationale 2

It's likely that top 30 customers will increase their purchases to our company because they've already proven that they use our product.

## Rationale 3

By being in the top 30 customers list, you show that you use our product heavily.

## Rationale N

We can provide special price discounts for purchases. A reduced price will cause an increase in purchases for those in our loyalty program because we can provide a service (a game in this case) for even less cost.
